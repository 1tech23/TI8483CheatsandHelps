  <h1>Below is a list of hex codes that I have found helpful.</h1>
  <h2>Battery Check Program</h2>
  <P>In order to get this to work, you must follow the directions EXACTLY as I have put them, or your calculator's memory could be cleared. That is never a good thing, as it literally deletes all programs and such. This will only happen if you do not put the code in correctly.</P> 
  <P>Step One: Press the PRGM button.</P>
  <P>Step Two: Press the right arrow key until you get to the tab that is labeled as NEW. Then press ENTER.</P>
  <P>Step Three: Name your program something that is useful and that makes your program easy to identify, such as BATTERY</P>
  <P>Step Four: Again, put in the following code EXACTLY as I have, omitting the : (colon)</P>
  <P>:AsmPrgrm</P>
  <P>:EF6F4C3D280A78FE1E</P>
  <P>:3805</P>
  <P>:EF21521808</P>
  <P>:EFB3503E042001AF</P>
  <P>:EF8C47EFBF4AC9</P>
  <P>Step Five: In order to run the program, exit the program menu (go to home), press 2ND+0 in order to get into the catalog. Then press the down arrow key until you get to AsmPrgm.</P>
  <P>Step Six: When you have pressed AsmPrgm on the home menu, press PRGM again, and search for the name program you have just made, select it. Then press ENTER.</P>
  <P>Congrats! You have just successfully made a battery check program!</P>
