  <h1>Below is a hex codes that I have found helpful.</h1>
  <h2>Enable Lowercase Letters Program</h2>
  <P>In order to get this to work, you must follow the directions EXACTLY as I have put them, or your calculator's memory could be cleared. That is never a good thing, as it literally deletes all programs and such. This will only happen if you do not put the code in correctly.</P> 
  <P>Step One: Press the PRGM button.</P>
  <P>Step Two: Press the right arrow key until you get to the tab that is labeled as NEW. Then press ENTER.</P>
  <P>Step Three: Name your program something that is useful and that makes your program easy to identify, such as LOWRCASE</P>
  <P>Step Four: Again, put in the following code EXACTLY as I have, omitting the : (colon)</P>
  <P>AsmPrgmFDCB24DEC9</P>
  <P>Step Five: In order to run the program, exit the program menu (go to home), press 2ND+0 in order to get into the catalog. Then press the down arrow key until you get to AsmPrgm.</P>
  <P>Step Six: When you have pressed AsmPrgm on the home menu, press PRGM again, and search for the name program you have just made, select it. Then press ENTER.</P>
  <P>Step Seven (optional): If you want to disable this program, simply type...</P>
  <P>:AsmPrgmFDCB249EC9</P>
  <P>Then repeat steps five through six.</P>
  <P>Congrats! You have just successfully made a prgram that enable lowercase letters!</P>
